# PAAS

The platform engineering - blend both PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) depending on which layer:

## ⚙️ Mostly PaaS (Platform as a Service)
These lean heavily on PaaS components for customization, orchestration, and deployment:

<li><b>LangChain Agents, FastAPI, Azure ML, MLflow, Feast →</b> Developer-centric tools used to build and deploy custom AI services

<li><b>Azure SQL, Azure Blob Storage, Redis, Postgres, Pinecone → </b>Platform-managed services for data storage and querying

<li><b>Power Automate / Azure Data Factory / Synapse → </b>Integrated data pipelines and task automation

These services provide infrastructure and tooling but require engineering effort to operationalize.

## 📦 Sometimes SaaS (Software as a Service)
SaaS enters the picture when these components are consumed as packaged applications:

<li><b>Power BI dashboards or Power Apps frontends → </b>No-code apps that provide business-ready interfaces

<li><b>Sentinel for security monitoring, Purview for data governance →</b> Operational tools consumed as turnkey software

<li><b>GPT-4, Claude via Azure, Ollama local LLMs →</b> Can be SaaS if you’re using hosted inference endpoints
